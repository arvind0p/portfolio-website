            <h3>Marketing Intern – PNB MetLife</h3>
            <p><em>Summer Internship</em></p>

            <p>
                Completed a structured summer internship focused on marketing operations,
                customer relationship management, and outbound sales activities. During
                this internship, I worked closely with senior team members to understand
                sales processes, customer engagement techniques, and insurance marketing
                strategies.
            </p>

            <p>
                I was actively involved in lead generation and customer outreach activities,
                where I communicated with potential customers to understand their needs
                and introduce suitable insurance solutions.
            </p>

            <p>
                My efforts contributed to a <strong>25% increase in qualified leads</strong>
                and supported the sales team in achieving a <strong>30% improvement in
                conversion rates</strong> through effective follow-ups and need-based
                customer interactions.
            </p>

            <p>
                This internship provided me with valuable exposure to real-world sales
                environments, professional communication, and performance-driven
                marketing practices.
