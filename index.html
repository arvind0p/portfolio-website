        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            I am a performance-oriented Marketing Executive based in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh,
            holding a Master of Business Administration (MBA) in Marketing. My academic
            training has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of marketing
            principles, sales management, consumer behavior, branding strategies,
            and operational planning.
        </p>

        <p>
            Professionally, I am currently associated with Artistick’s Art Forum Pvt. Ltd.,
            where I support sales operations, client acquisition initiatives, and
            relationship management activities. My role involves identifying new business
            opportunities, engaging with prospective clients, understanding their
            requirements, and assisting in negotiation and deal-closure processes.
        </p>

        <p>
            During my internship at PNB MetLife, I gained practical exposure to
            outbound sales strategies, structured follow-ups, and CRM systems.
            Through consistent communication and need-based selling approaches,
            I contributed to a 25% increase in qualified leads and supported a
            30% improvement in customer conversion rates.
        </p>

        <p>
            I strongly believe in a customer-centric and data-driven marketing approach.
            My long-term objective is to grow into leadership roles where I can
            strategically contribute to business expansion, mentor teams, and drive
            sustainable organizational growth.
