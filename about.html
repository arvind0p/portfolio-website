    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
        I am a motivated and results-oriented Marketing Executive based in Lucknow, India,
        with a Master of Business Administration (MBA) in Marketing. My academic background
        has provided me with a strong understanding of marketing strategy, sales management,
        consumer behavior, and business operations.
    </p>

    <p>
        Professionally, I have gained hands-on experience in sales operations, lead generation,
        customer relationship management, and business development. I have worked closely
        with clients to understand their requirements, identify growth opportunities, and
        deliver solutions that align with organizational objectives.
    </p>

    <p>
        During my professional journey, I have been actively involved in prospecting,
        negotiating, and closing deals, as well as supporting promotional campaigns and
        exhibitions to enhance brand visibility. I believe in maintaining long-term
        relationships with clients by providing consistent value and professional service.
    </p>

    <p>
        I strongly believe in a customer-centric and data-driven approach to marketing.
        I enjoy analyzing market trends, understanding customer needs, and converting
        insights into actionable marketing strategies that contribute to measurable business
        outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am a quick learner, adaptable to new environments, and comfortable working in
        fast-paced, performance-driven settings. My long-term goal is to grow into leadership
        roles where I can contribute strategically to organizational growth, mentor teams,
        and drive sustainable business success.
