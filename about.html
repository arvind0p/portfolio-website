    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a dedicated and growth-focused Marketing Executive based in Lucknow, India.
        I hold an MBA in Marketing, which has provided me with a strong foundation in
        marketing strategy, sales operations, and business development.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have hands-on experience in lead generation, client handling, and supporting
        promotional campaigns. I believe in a customer-centric and data-driven approach
        to marketing and enjoy working in fast-paced, growth-oriented environments.
    </p>
    <p>
        My long-term goal is to grow into leadership roles where I can contribute
        strategically to organizational success.
