<h2>Professional Summary</h2>

<p>
I am an MBA graduate in Marketing with comprehensive hands-on experience 
across branding strategy, startup positioning, business development, 
customer relationship management (CRM), and structured lead generation systems. 
My professional approach is rooted in clarity-driven positioning, 
performance optimization, and measurable business impact.
</p>

<p>
Currently serving as a Marketing Executive & Branding Expert at Clicknify, 
I collaborate with founder-led startups to strengthen brand positioning 
and improve conversion performance before design execution. 
My role involves developing strategic messaging frameworks, 
optimizing landing page communication, conducting brand audits, 
and ensuring alignment between business objectives and customer expectations. 
I work closely with UI/UX teams to ensure that clarity and positioning 
are established before visual development begins, minimizing inefficiencies 
and maximizing strategic impact.
</p>

<p>
Previously, at Artistick’s Art Forum Pvt. Ltd., I supported structured 
sales operations, client lifecycle engagement, negotiation processes, 
and promotional campaign coordination. I contributed to revenue-generating 
initiatives and improved customer retention processes through systematic 
communication and CRM-driven follow-ups.
</p>

<p>
During my internship at PNB MetLife, I applied consultative selling 
techniques and structured follow-up systems that contributed to a 
25% increase in qualified leads and supported a 30% improvement in 
conversion rates. This experience strengthened my understanding of 
performance tracking, pipeline management, and data-informed decision-making.
</p>

<p>
My long-term objective is to grow into leadership roles where I can 
strategically drive marketing transformation initiatives, mentor 
high-performing teams, and contribute to sustainable business growth 
through clarity-driven branding and revenue-focused execution.
