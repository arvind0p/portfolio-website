<h2>Professional Profile</h2>

<p>
I am a results-oriented Marketing Executive with an MBA in Marketing,
possessing strong expertise in sales strategy, business development,
lead generation, and customer relationship management.
My academic foundation combined with hands-on experience enables
me to bridge strategic planning with operational execution.
</p>

<p>
Currently working at Artistick’s Art Forum Pvt. Ltd., I contribute to
business expansion initiatives, revenue generation activities, and
client engagement processes. I actively support prospect identification,
requirement analysis, proposal coordination, negotiation assistance,
and promotional campaign execution.
</p>

<p>
During my internship at PNB MetLife, I applied structured sales approaches
and CRM techniques that contributed to a 25% increase in qualified leads
and supported a 30% improvement in conversion rates.
</p>

<p>
My long-term objective is to transition into leadership roles where I can
drive strategic marketing initiatives, mentor high-performing teams,
and contribute to sustainable business growth.
